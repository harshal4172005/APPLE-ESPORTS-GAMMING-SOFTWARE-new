/// tick "End of Day" for an operator, watch the server save it, and the counter would never
/// hear of it. Every setting on the server was decoration.
///
/// It travels in the heartbeat reply rather than over anything new. A branch is already
/// speaking to Head Office every three seconds and already reading the answer, so a change
/// lands within three seconds of being made, over a connection that exists, with no second
/// mechanism to keep working.
///
/// Sent only when something actually changed. The branch reports the <see cref="Version"/> it
/// currently holds and Head Office replies with nothing at all when it matches - so the
/// ordinary case stays a few hundred bytes, and the full list only crosses the wire on the
/// rare beat after somebody edits a permission.
///
/// This is deliberately configuration and never operational state. Who exists and what they
/// are allowed to see belongs to Head Office. Who is on shift right now belongs to the branch,
/// which is the only place that can know it.
