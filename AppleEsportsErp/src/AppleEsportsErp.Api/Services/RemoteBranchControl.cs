/// Lets Head Office drive any branch, by asking rather than by writing.
///
/// The requirement is simple and was asked for plainly: from Head Office, do anything - stop a
/// session at any shop, start one, take a PC out of service. What made it hard was that the
/// obvious implementation is wrong in a way that looks right for about three seconds.
///
/// Head Office holds a synced copy of every branch's rows. Writing to that copy is easy, and
/// it updates the Head Office screen immediately, so it demos perfectly. It also does nothing
/// whatsoever. The shop's own database is a different machine in a different city; it has not
/// been told, so the counter still shows the PC as busy, the operator still cannot bill it, and
/// three seconds later that shop's next heartbeat reports the truth and Head Office's screen
/// flips back. That is the "sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't" everybody has been
/// chasing, and it is not a race condition to be tightened up - the write was never real.
///
/// So Head Office states an intent and the branch carries it out, through the identical code
/// path an operator's own click uses. The session is stopped by the shop that has the customer,
/// the cash and the till. It is billed normally, it lands in that shift's takings, and it syncs
/// back up on its own. Head Office and the branch agree afterwards because only one of them
/// ever acted - and the one that acted is the one that could.
///
/// The cost is that a command is not instant: it is queued, collected on the next beat, and
/// confirmed. In practice that is a few seconds, and it is honest about them. An instant lie
/// was what we had before.
