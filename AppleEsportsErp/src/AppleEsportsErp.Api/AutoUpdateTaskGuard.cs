/// Makes sure the branch's own auto-update scheduled task exists, the same way DbUpdater makes
/// sure the schema does - checked on every startup, not only once.
///
/// The task ("AppleEsports Auto Update", see apply-update.ps1) is what actually installs a new
/// version with nothing to click. Until now the ONLY thing that ever created it was the
/// installer's own [Run] step, and the only thing that ever tried to repair it afterwards was
/// the desktop app, on every launch (KioskGuard.EnsureAutoUpdateTask). That repair attempt looks
/// like self-healing but is not: creating a task that runs /RU SYSTEM /RL HIGHEST needs an
/// elevated caller, and the desktop app runs as whoever is logged in - ordinarily not elevated,
/// even on an administrator's own account, because Windows does not elevate an app just because
/// the user could approve a prompt. So the desktop app's attempt has been silently failing on
/// every ordinary launch all along; it only ever worked once, immediately after install, when it
/// inherited the installer's own elevation for that one run.
///
/// The result: the task survives fine on its own once created, right up until something outside
/// this app's control disturbs it - a Windows Update, security software flagging an unusual
/// SYSTEM-level task, someone tidying Task Scheduler by hand. From that moment on nothing could
/// ever recreate it again short of a full reinstall, and the branch would sit on the same
/// version forever, with the Updates page still honestly reporting a newer one waiting - "the
/// update is coming, but it never installs" is exactly the shape of this exact fault.
///
/// The branch API is the fix, because it is the one thing on this machine that is guaranteed
/// both elevated and running: it starts as a Windows service at boot, before anyone logs in, and
/// keeps running whether anyone ever does. Doing this here instead reaches the one class of
/// machine this whole problem was reported on - a counter PC, where the branch API is a
/// service - without needing to touch anything else.
