    /// The last line of defence against Head Office writing a branch's trading directly.
    ///
    /// Head Office can now start and stop play at any shop - that was asked for and it is
    /// built. What it does not do is write the session itself. It sends the branch an
    /// instruction, the branch runs this same method locally, and the result syncs back. So by
    /// the time execution reaches here, it is always a branch doing its own work, and Head
    /// Office reaching this point means something has bypassed the command queue.
    ///
    /// Why that must still throw, when the feature exists: sync carries operations one way. A
    /// session written into Head Office's copy is written nowhere else. The counter never sees
    /// it, so no operator can stop or bill it, and a customer sits there playing for free.
    /// Exactly that happened on ADJ-PC-01 - Head Office showed an hour running and counting
    /// down while the counter showed PC-01 free. It also explains a Stop button that "does
    /// nothing": start on one screen, stop on the other, and there is nothing there to stop.
    ///
    /// The message names the queue, because anybody who hits this is one call away from the
    /// thing they actually wanted.
    /// </summary>
    /// <summary>
    /// Records that an attempt to touch a session did not work, before the exception is
    /// rethrown to whoever is actually waiting on it.
    ///
    /// Every one of these five methods already tells the person at the counter why it failed -
    /// a toast, a red banner, gone the moment they click past it. None of that was ever kept.
    /// "PC not idle", "insufficient wallet balance", a session somebody tried to start twice -
    /// all of it happened, all of it mattered to somebody at the time, and none of it could be
    /// looked back on the next morning. This is the same audit trail every successful session
    /// action already writes to; a failure was simply the one outcome it never recorded.
    ///
    /// Never allowed to throw itself - AuditService.LogAsync already swallows its own failures,

    /// note-taking about the first failure went wrong.
