{ Whether this machine is already an operator counter PC running the branch.

  Decided from what is actually on disk and registered with Windows, never from what the
  installer was told. This is what makes a silent update correct.

  The fault it fixes: an update is launched with /VERYSILENT and no /TYPE or /COMPONENTS,
  because the updater has no way of knowing what the machine chose when it was first set up.
  Inno then falls back to the default type, "server" is not selected, and every file tagged
  Components: server is skipped - the entire API and PostgreSQL. The dashboard window has no
  component restriction, so THAT gets replaced.

  The result is the worst kind of half-update: a new front end talking to an old engine, with
  the version on screen reporting the new number. Seen on a real branch - the window said 2.2.2
  while the API was still the previous build, and nothing anywhere said the update had only
  partly happened. Worse, the script that restarts the services is guarded by the same check, so
  an update could stop the branch and never start it again.

  A machine that is already running the branch is always updated as one. }

  On an upgrade the API is running as a service with its own DLLs open, so the copy fails

  PrepareToInstall stops them both before a single file is copied, so every path out of the
  post-install step has to leave them running again. A setup script that fails is a problem;
  a setup script that fails and also leaves the shop switched off is a much larger one, and
  the operator has no way of telling the two apart.

    behind it left a real gap: a request landing in that window got a database refusing the
    connection, surfaced to whoever was standing at the counter as a bare "Internal server
    error" with no way to know it would resolve itself in a few seconds. setup-database.ps1

  { The guard that took a real branch offline.

    PrepareToInstall stops both services using InstallServerParts(), which is true whenever
    this machine already runs the branch. This line used IsComponentSelected('server') on its
    own - and that is FALSE during a silent update, because the updater passes no /COMPONENTS
    and Inno falls back to the default type.

    So a silent update stopped the branch, replaced its files, and then returned here and gave
    up before running the scripts that start it again. Both services left stopped, and a
    dashboard showing "Cannot reach the branch system" with a list of things to check, none of
    which were wrong. A shop taking an update overnight would have opened to a dead counter.

    Whatever decides to stop the branch and whatever decides to start it again must be the

  This is the one that would have saved a real branch. An update stopped both services in
  PrepareToInstall, began copying, failed partway, and Inno rolled the files back - so setup
  ended without ever reaching ssPostInstall. Every restart-the-services path lives in
  CurStepChanged, none of it ran, and the counter PC was left with the old version installed
  and both services stopped. Sixteen minutes later somebody had to start them by hand.

  Rolling the files back is right. Leaving the shop switched off is not, and a failed upgrade
  must always end with the branch running whatever version it had before - that version worked
  this morning and is worth infinitely more than a tidy exit.

  DeinitializeSetup runs on success, on failure and on cancel alike, which is exactly the
  guarantee needed here. On a gaming PC or a fresh install the services do not exist and
  sc.exe simply reports so. }
